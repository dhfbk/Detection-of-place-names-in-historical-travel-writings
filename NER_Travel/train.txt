From	O

we	O
took	O
a	O

across	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
Varese	B-LOCATION

passing	O
through	O

there	O

in	O
the	O

The	O
road	O
is	O
a	O
pleasant	O
one	O

does	O
not	O

through	O
any	O

remarkable	O

Travellers	O
taking	O
this	O
road	O
had	O
better	O
leave	O
every	O
cigarette	O
behind	O
them	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O

duty	O

I	O
had	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O

in	O

was	O

the	O
searching	O

Varese	B-LOCATION
we	O
went	O

four	O

Close	O
to	O
the	O

just	O

through	O

the	O

not	O

Here	O
we	O
rested	O
and	O
watched	O
the	O
pilgrims	O
going	O
up	O

down	O

They	O
seemed	O
very	O
good-humoured	O

merry	O

Then	O
we	O
looked	O
through	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
first	O
chapel	O
inside	O
the	O
arch	O

found	O
it	O
to	O
contain	O
a	O
representation	O
of	O
the	O
Annunciation	O

The	O
Virgin	O
had	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
already	O

about	O

of	O
these	O

two	O

may	O

it	O
appears	O
to	O

is	O
to	O

was	O

the	O

in	O

perhaps	O
you	O

the	O

the	O

you	O

most	O

the	O

it	O

we	O
