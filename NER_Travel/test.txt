At	O

loved	O
them	O
all	O

If	O
you	O
come	O
with	O
me	O
I	O
shall	O
take	O
you	O
away	O
from	O
the	O

cities	O
where	O
your	O
feet	O
are	O
bruised	O
on	O
the	O

never	O

where	O
mountainous	O
walls	O

limit	O
your	O
vision	O
to	O
smoke-clouded	O
strips	O

where	O
you	O
never	O
smell	O
the	O
fragrance	O
of	O
the	O
night	O

If	O
you	O
come	O
with	O
me	O
I	O
shall	O
take	O
you	O
to	O
the	O
hills	O

deep-bosomed	O
rolling	O
hills	O

with	O

You	O
will	O
lie	O
with	O
me	O
under	O

I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
there	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
a	O
